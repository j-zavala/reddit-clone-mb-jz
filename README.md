Best Thing That Happened Today

A loosely-based-off-of-reddit clone

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
This project is a rough clone of reddit, being loosely based on it.

Technologies Used
Link and Resources
• Reddit.com
• Figma.com –The initial mockup.
• https://thenounproject.com/ - For avatars for the initial reddit clone
• http://avatars.adorable.io/ -For the avatar for the unfinished home page in our current product

Approach Taken
We started with implementing a mockup for the initial version of our site, which is supposed to be dedicated to food recipes. We had an initial html, jss, and css, dedicated for the landing page. Initially we also had another html which was supposed to direct from the landing page to the home page. However, as time ran on, we ended up running into coding issues and problems, as well as our code on all ends becoming needlessly complex. This happened as we tried to work on all technologies simultaneously, and it was a learning experience for how to better organize on future projects.

We decided to start from scratch where we made another clone dedicated to “The Best Day Ever” stories. With this we implemented one html(index) that combined the home page and landing page in one. With this, you would sign in and refresh the page. Afterwards you would now have a log in using your email and password. Upon logging in you are now able to see the posts and comment section where you can see your post as well as all the other posts made.

How to Use
Start at the landing page, which is the webpage asking the user to sign up or login. As a new user, you can register with email. As a returning user all you have to do is input your email and previously set password. Click "log in" and you be taken a page that has post and comment boxes. Here you can leave a post. After you click "post", you'll see the most recent post added to the list of posts.

Unsolved problems

- sign up does not redirect to post and comment box
- posts are cluttered
- comment box has no functionality
